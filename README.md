# They Matter 
<span style="color: black">
  

  <p>API developed for Generation Brasil Integrator Project.</p>
<p>They Matter, an ecommerce that aims to assist species preservation institutes that have low visibility by the population, because by prioritizing only the conservation of charismatic species, also known as "flag species", there is a risk of distorting priorities, in which they are favored over species at greater risk and not so popular. Thus we believe that not only more resources are destined to the environment, but that people understand that all species have their function in nature and are important for the maintenance of our ecosystem.</p>
